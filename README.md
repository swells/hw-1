# Exercise 1.0 – Hello, world!
Recall that a program is just a set of instructions for the computer to execute. Let’s start with a basic command:
print x: Prints the value of the expression x, followed by a new line.
Create a new Python program called hello_world.py. You will use this file to write your very first 'Hello, world!' program.

## How to create a program file:

## Printing

```py
print('Hello, world!')
```


## Variables
Variables are containers for storing information. For example:
Program Text:
```py
a = 'Hello, world!'
print(a)
```
`Output:`
```Hello, world!```
